 Control Caffeine from Emacs
=============================
 
`Caffeine <http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine>`_ is a small app to keep
your `Mac <http://www.apple.com/mac/>`_ awake. This package provides a
button in the mode line to control Caffeine which can be handy when
using emacs in fullscreen mode.

This package requires function ``do-applescript`` to work.
